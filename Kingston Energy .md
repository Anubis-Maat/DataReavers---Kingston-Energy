# DataReavers---Kingston-Energy
Kingston Energy is a Waste-to-Energy Tracking System that revolutionises municipal waste collection in Kingston, Jamaica by transforming traditional operations into a smart, data-driven service. The platform provides real-time GPS tracking of collection trucks, dynamic route optimisation, and predictive maintenance alerts through an intelligent monitoring system. It solves critical inefficiencies in traditional waste management by automatically re-routing trucks when they reach capacity, predicting maintenance needs before breakdowns occur, and optimising collection routes to reduce fuel consumption and operational costs.

The system delivers comprehensive environmental and operational benefits through live monitoring of key performance metrics. It tracks waste processing volumes, steam energy generation, carbon offset achievements, and the number of homes powered by waste-to-energy conversion. The AI alert system proactively identifies safety concerns, weather impacts, and efficiency opportunities, while role-based access ensures appropriate information delivery to administrators, managers, and residents.

By integrating real-time data analytics with predictive AI capabilities, the platform enables proactive decision-making and resource allocation. This results in extended equipment lifespan, reduced environmental impact, improved collection reliability, and enhanced public service delivery, ultimately creating a more sustainable and efficient waste management ecosystem for the Kingston community.
